Create a Reminder Application which allows user to add notes dynamically with: 
 
1. Reminder text
2. Remind date and time (on specific hour, specific date)
 
Save those Reminder values on localStorage or you can also use a file if you will create a api for it. 
 
After user will be notified allow user to remove notes from the list. 
 
when Remind time arrives. Notify user about his notes with popup message. 
 
For frontend side you can use bootstrap, flexgrid … anything 
For storage purposes you can use localStorage, file, even db …
